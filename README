This driver is for OpenSolaris. there will be no KMS support and only for computing.

nouveau_pscmm.c and nouveau_pscmm.h are the core part of PathScale memory manager which is part of nouveau kernel driver.
The ioctls reserved from current nouveau will not be shown here. They includes nouveau_ioctl_fifo_alloc, nouveau_ioctl_fifo_free, nouveau_ioctl_grobj_alloc nouveau_ioctl_notifier_alloc and etc.

The init code of drm/nouveau have not done yet. (Implement soon)

It assume that 
    VRAM can be divided into two parts, non-page and page.
    non-page includes scanout, hardware-status page etc which will not be evicted and shared by all channels.
    page part for user bos. pscmm files are only focus on user bo alloc/free, evict, move, mmap, exec and etc. 
    Only two types of memory: VRAM and system RAM. No GART support by now. (Improved at next)
    The per-channel page table init at the channel_init and not changed then. (Improved at next)
    No mmap/flush_range at first (Improved at next)

For bo alloc/free, it use the algorithm in drm_mm.c (buddy). 
For bo evict/replacement, it introduce a no_evicted list to track the no_evicted bo. For other bo, it will use modified CAR to do replacement if the VRAM is full.

For more detail, please check the pscmm plan.

By now, it's only a skeletal code, can't be build or use. More implement will be next. 

Any feedback or suggestions, please send to me lkice@hotmail.com.



HOW TO BUILD
1. Build OpenSolaris b134 or later from source.
2. cp the project to usr/src/uts/intel/ (E.g. cp -r pscmm /WORKSPCAE/usr/src/uts/intel/)
3. make all (build drm binarie)
4. cd nouveau && make all (build nouveau binarie)
