Currently disabled temporarily:
- anything i2c, probably displayport soon as well

Anything touching i2c:
- i2c methods in nouveau_bios
- hwmon (temperature) support
- nv04 tv/dfp
- displayport

Not implemented at all:
- vga switcheroo / arbiter

TODO:
- framebuffer
- fixup vm
- fixup io
- compile failures general
- Maybe figure out wtf special casing nForce + old nv04 was for in nouveau_calc?
